			span#ourstory OUR STORY
			p#description URStash is created by UR students for UR students. We were tired of overpriced books, and decided to bring this website to you so that you'd save those bucks for beach week instead of spending it on a $200 calculus text book. Had to throw away your furniture and electronics because you couldn't take them back home? We got you covered.
